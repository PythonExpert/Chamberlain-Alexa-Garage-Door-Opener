## Setting Up
Unfortunately, due to the skill being unofficial, I cannot publish to the Alexa Skill store. The only way this skill can
be used is via a developer account. You'll need to make a developer account with Amazon and you'll need either AWS
Lambda or a web service that adheres to Amazon's requirements which can be found [here](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills/host-a-custom-skill-as-a-web-service.html)

More information on setup will be provided soon!

## Usage
Using the garage door opener skill is easy!

Just say Open garage door opener to open the skill. From there, you can do one of the following:

1. Is the garage door open?
2. Is the garage door closed?
3. Check the status of the garage door.
4. Open the garage door.
5. Close the garage door.

It is as simple as that!

## Contributions & Issues
Issues are inevitable and this is bound to happen considering I've only tested this with my own garage door. 
Contributions are always welcome, and I encourage any issue reports to be submitted. I am also willing to 
look into feature requests as well.

## Disclaimer
This is an unofficial Alexa skill for Chamberlain's Garage Door which was created by reverse engineering the API, and this
skill could possibly be broken anytime due to API changes. I will try my best to keep the code updated. Also note that the author 
doesn't claim responsibility for any damages whatsoever.
